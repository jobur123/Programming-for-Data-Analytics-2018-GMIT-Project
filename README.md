This repository contains, primarily, a Jupyter notebook which investigates and simulates a dataset of an Obesity 
survey of first class children in Ireland.

To run the notebook, you must have [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine.
You can install this using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution.

The notebook itself is called `Childhood Obesity Analysis Ireland.ipynb`.
